        <h2>Representing the Buyers</h2>
        <p> Let&rsquo;s be honest: The Seattle real estate market is a tough  market for buyers. In the greater  Seattle area desirable residential properties often sell within hours of first  appearing on the market. The flip side  of that coin is that sometimes sellers won&rsquo;t sell to the first able buyer on  the scene; often sellers will wait for days, sometimes up to a week, prior to  reviewing offers in order to create a multiple offer situation. What you need, as a buyer, is an agent who  can position you to win. </p>
        <p> Kevin and David understand this challenge and  they have a proven record of repeatedly winning in multiple offer  situations. This is because they  understand that when purchasing a home the key to winning is preparation. David and Kevin are prepared. They have years and years of successful offer  presentations in Seattle&rsquo;s hot market under their belts along with a vast  network of agents they are great terms with, lenders you can trust, and  home inspectors that you can rely on. </p>
        <p> When it&rsquo;s time for you to purchase David and  Kevin will spend as much time as you need getting YOU prepared. For you preparation means knowing the housing  stock, knowing how much you can spend and that a quality mortgage lender has  your back, knowing what a fixed amount can buy you in different and varied neighborhoods, and knowing that when you find the right house an inspector with  skill, knowledge and personal integrity will inspect it for you. Beyond that preparation means you  understanding the contract you are about to execute, and fully understanding  all of the contingencies you are going to include, or exclude, as you  strategize to make your offer the winning offer. </p>
        <p> All of this is easier when you work with Kevin  and David. They are experienced guides  who will see you through the buying maze from looking at your first house to  stopping by when you unpack your first box. </p>
