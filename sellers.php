        <h2>Representing the Sellers</h2>
       <p>
            Yes, it  does matter who you list your home with.  There is a difference. You&rsquo;ll  understand the difference after just one meeting with Kevin and David.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many home sellers in Seattle know how hot this market is and many  of them make the mistake of thinking all agents do basically the same  thing. Some sellers even think that some  start-up online &quot;real estate company&quot; will do the same thing for them  that Windermere can. Well that&rsquo;s just  not the case. The online company may  have a satellite image of your street, and they may know what the house down  the street sold for, but there&rsquo;s so much more to it than that.
          </p>

          <p>
            There&rsquo;s the market intelligence and wisdom that  you can only get with dedicated, diligent and experienced full-time  agents. As a seller you need agents who  have actually seen the houses they are comparing yours to, agents who  understand construction and who really get design, finishes and quality  workmanship. You need agents who know  that the reason why the same sized house in the same area had greatly different  selling prices when all was said and done.  David and Kevin are those agents.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a vast difference in agents and what  they will do for you, just as there is a world of difference in having the  power of Windermere behind your home sale.  Kevin and David will go the extra mile for you. Often meeting with sellers months before a  home goes on the market, Kevin and David will coach and guide to help you, the  seller, take your house to its maximum selling point. They work with you to position your home for  a quick and solid sale. Their network  includes everyone from cleaners and handyman to roofers, painters and  gardeners, from designers to stagers. If  you need it, they either have it or can find it for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their supreme knowledge of the local market,  combined with their listing support network, and the excellent relationships  they have fostered with top selling agents in the Seattle market ensures success, YOUR  success. You won&rsquo;t regret listing your  home with Kevin and David.
