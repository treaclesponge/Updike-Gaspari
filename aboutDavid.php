        <h2>David Updike</h2>
        <p><span class="firstLetter">Seattle </span> has been our family roots now for two generations.My father and I were both born in Seattle. My grandfather lived in Seattle and enjoyed a  career as a carpenter building a number of homes in the Ballard and Phinney  Ridge neighborhoods in the 1920&rsquo;s. My  father was born at home, one of six children. I was born at the former Northgate Mall hospital 39 years later. My father&rsquo;s career as a United Methodist  minister led my family from Seattle to various small town Washington  communities. I've lived in Lynden, Ritzville,  Colville and Spokane. My childhood  memories are of growing up in these towns and making annual visits to our  relative and friends in Seattle, Hood Canal and on Whidbey Island. I always  enjoyed our visits to Seattle and was captivated with its scenic beauty and  wealth of cultural opportunities. I knew  growing up that I'd live in Seattle as an adult.</p>
        <p>My college career consisted of one year back  east at Hobart College and then three years at the University of Washington  culminating in a BA in History in 1980. I enjoyed two semesters of study abroad in Europe. The first was an art history program in  Italy. In this program I spent time in  Venice, Florence and Rome. My second  semester abroad was a history program in London.</p>
        <p>Following some time living abroad in Spain, and  then back in the states in Texas, I returned to Seattle in 1984 and have been a  full time Seattle resident since. In  February of 1985 I met my life partner, Michael. Twenty some years later, and six remodels  later, and after 20 full years living either in the Central Area or on Capitol  Hill, we moved north. We are now 8 miles  north of where the center of our lives used to be. It's a shock. The draw was an absolutely amazing house (well it amazes us) with a yard  that's just shy of 10,000 square feet. The house &quot;wowed&quot; both of us instantly and Michael saw 10,000  square feet of landscaping fantasies and was &quot;there&quot; before we left  the house the first time. (Michael's  previous gardening opportunities all took place the roof of a 1910 apartment  building we renovated; he missed soil that wasn't in pots.)</p>
        <p>So now we're renovating a classic 1956  mid-century modern home in the Matthews Beach area. It is  short block from an entrance to the Burke-Gilman Trail and, once you're on the  trail, the beach is just a short walk away. One of us is down there daily with Inga, our seven year old Weimareiner,  also known as the light of our lives. This radical shift in location and home style preferences evolved out of  repeated visits to Palm Springs, California over a span of about eight  years. Time in the desert led to a new  appreciation of the architecture and design of the 1950s. Eventually we bought a vacation home in Palm  Springs to enjoy sunny retreats from our light deprived Seattle winters. In short order we became swept up in the  national trend celebrating all things mid-century. In retrospect it seems inevitable that our  newfound respect for mid-century homes there would lead to us to either build a  contemporary home there or find a period 1950s home to renovate in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Our lives would not be complete without our two  15 year old cats, brother and sister cats, Calvin and Claire.</p>
        <p>I'm in touch with Seattle's real estate  (literally) on a daily basis in more ways than one. I touch it with my feet: I run. Though I live a block from one of the best running trails in the world,  my favorite running path still begins and end in Seattle&rsquo;s best place: the Pike Place Market in downtown  Seattle. My 7 mile route ambles down  Western Avenue to Seattle&rsquo;s waterfront and then along Elliott Avenue and  through Myrtle Edward Park. On clear  mornings the views of Elliott Bay, the Olympic Mountains and Mt. Rainier are  stunning. These views, and the sights  and smells of the market and sea water along the way, serve as a constant  reminder of why I love this city as much as I do. Each day I'm reminded of why I live here and  I understand better why my clients want to live here as well.</p>
        <p>As I leave the park my route loops back towards  downtown along Elliott again, then up Mercer Street and through lower Queen  Anne. I detour through the center of the  Seattle Center and connect to Fifth Avenue all the way to Westlake Mall and  then back to the center of the market. It is fascinating to witness the pace of change and development within  the downtown corridor and the terrific improvements to the waterfront district  and park. I see the wide range of  condominiums, apartments, offices and businesses that have sprung up. Some of these projects are spectacular and some  of them are merely mediocre. I am  excited by the pace of change however, even more so after when I think of the  many years of neglect this section of Seattle experienced. Now more and more people are choosing to live  downtown and enjoy these new amenities which are close at hand. Though I live elsewhere now, my time downtown  connects me to other lifestyles and housing options.</p>

        <p>My philosophy of urban living is that we all  need to step up and do everything that we can to make our city work. Having a stake hold in our city means raising  one&rsquo;s voice and speaking out. However complex or basic the issues are,  whether it's affordable housing, mass transit or simply dog parks in the city,  the more people who are involved the better it is for responsible, accountable  government. Investing in real estate and  creating a home here in Seattle&nbsp;is the first step to take. I want to help people take that step.</p>
